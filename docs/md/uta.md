## IT Assistant
*Jan 2022 - Apr 2022*

After I graduated from UT Arlington, I continued most of the same responsibilities from my Student Associate position with an emphasis on training our new student workers. During this time, I helped modernize our device imaging process with System Center Configuration Manager by building our own application packages, usually with custom PowerShell installation scripts. The result was a nearly hands-off process that significantly reduced turnaround time.

Skills:
* Desktop Imaging
* ServiceNow
* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
* PowerShell

## Student Associate
*Aug 2018 - Dec 2021*

I primarily responded to IT help desk tickets for the University Police Department and assisted other employees with technical questions and problems. I also imaged and deployed PCs and securely erased old devices. As needed, I assisted with other special projects, such as inventory tracking and panic button testing. Starting in 2020, I developed a web-based vehicle management interface for the officers, which tracks basic vehicle usage and maintenance history. This replaced a whiteboard and physical paper forms/slips.

Skills:
* Spiceworks
* TypeScript
* Active Directory
* Troubleshooting
* Windows 10
* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
* PowerShell
* React
* Node
